    "# Q1: Simple CNN network for PASCAL multi-label classification (20 points)\n",
    "Now let’s try to recognize some natural images. We provided some starter code for this task. The following steps will guide you through the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Setup the dataset\n",
    "We start by modifying the code to read images from the PASCAL 2007 dataset. The important thing to note is that PASCAL can have multiple objects present in the same image. Hence, this is a multi-label classification problem, and will have to be tackled slightly differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, download the data. `cd` to a location where you can store 0.5GB of images. Then run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",

    "## 1.2 Write a dataloader with data augmentation (5 pts)\n",
    "**Dataloader** The first step is to write a [pytorch data loader](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html) which loads this PASCAL data. Browse the folders and files under `VOCdevkit` to understand the structure and labeling. Complete the functions `preload_anno` and `__getitem__` in `voc_dataset.py` according to the following instructions and the instructions in the code. More information about the dataset can be found [here](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/devkit_doc_07-Jun-2007.pdf). We will use data in ‘trainval’ for training and ‘test’ for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `preload_anno`: This function will be called when the dataloader is initialized. We will load the annotations under folder `Annotations`. Each .xml file in the `Annotations` folder corresponds to the image with the same name under `JPEGImages`. In this function, we need to load `label` and `weight` vectors for each image according to the .xml file. \n",
    "- The labels should be 0 by default. Assign 1 for each class label in the .xml file. For example, in 000001.xml, the label vector should have 1s at the class indices correspond to 'dog' and 'person'. The rest of the vector should be 0.\n",
    "- The weights should be 1 by defatul. For each class label in the image, if 'difficult'=1 (which means it is ambiguous), we will assign 0 for the weight vector at this class index. This weight will be used when we calculate the test performance. We will not consider the ambiguous labels during testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getitem__`: This function will be called when the dataloader is called during training. It takes as input the index, and returns a tuple - `(image, label, weight)`. You need to load the image from the `JPEGImages` folder and load the corresponding label and weight using `self.anno_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Augmentation** Modify `__getitem__` to randomly *augment* each datapoint using [TORCHVISION.TRANSFORMS](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html).  Make sure the data augmentation is only used for training data (based on self.split). Please describe what data augmentation you implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before any augmentation, resize all the images based on `self.size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hint**: Since we are training a model from scratch on this small dataset, it is important to perform basic data augmentation to avoid overfitting. Add random crops and left-right flips when training, and do a center crop when testing, etc. As for natural images, another common practice is to subtract the mean values of RGB images from ImageNet dataset. The mean values for RGB images are: `[123.68, 116.78, 103.94]`. You may also rescale the images to `[−1, 1]`. There is no \"correct\" answer here! Feel free to search online about the data augmentation methods people usually use.\n",

    "To evaluate the trained model, we will use a standard metric for multi-label evaluation - [mean average precision (mAP)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html). Please implement `eval_dataset_map` in `utils.py` - this function will evaluate a model's map score using a given dataset object. You will need to make predictions on the given dataset with the model and call `compute_ap` to get average precision.\n",
